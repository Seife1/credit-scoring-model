# Credit Scoring Model for Bati Bank

This repository contains a Credit Scoring Model built for Bati Bank as part of the Week 6 Challenge at 10 Academy. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that assesses the credit risk of customers using their transaction data from an eCommerce platform. The model predicts whether a customer is likely to default on a loan and also provides a credit score based on risk probability estimates.

## Project Overview
Bati Bank is partnering with an eCommerce platform to provide a buy-now-pay-later service. The aim is to assess the creditworthiness of customers and predict the likelihood of default on future loans. This project involves:
1. Defining a proxy variable for default risk.
2. Performing feature engineering to extract key features from transaction data.
3. Developing models to predict the credit score and the optimal loan amount.
4. Serving the model via a REST API for real-time predictions.

<!-- ## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seife1/credit-scoring-model.git
   cd credit-scoring-model
